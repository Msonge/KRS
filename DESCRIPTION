Description: Manipulates a dataset on the effects of elephant damage on the tree growth rate. 
             It mainly explores the dataset to see how elephant damage has impact on the growth
             of trees. It also looks at how abiotic and biotic factors affect the growth rate of trees 
             directly and how these factors modify the effect of elephants damage.
